# Neural Style Transfer - Photo filters a la Prisma

Most of the code referenced in the notebook is from the deeplearning.ai coursera specialization
For the reimplementation using feedforward I drew inspiration from this medium post

The pretrained model used is from the Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Visual Recognition Project
`Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition', Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman, arXiv technical report, 2014, (paper).
